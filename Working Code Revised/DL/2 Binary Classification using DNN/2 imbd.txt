I'd be glad to explain the code in detail:
Imports:
Python
from keras.datasets import imdb
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score


* keras.datasets.imdb: This line imports the imdb function from the keras.datasets module. This function is used to load the IMDB movie review sentiment classification dataset.
* numpy: This imports the numpy library, a powerful numerical computation library in Python.
* keras.models: This imports the Sequential class from the keras.models module, used to create sequential neural network models.
* keras.layers: This imports the Dense class from the keras.layers module, used to create dense (fully connected) layers in neural networks.
* sklearn.metrics: This imports several metrics functions from the sklearn.metrics module used for evaluating the performance of a classification model.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Python
(train_data, train_label), (test_data, test_label) = imdb.load_data(num_words=10000)


def vectorize_sequences(sequences, dimensions=10000):
  results = np.zeros((len(sequences), dimensions))
  for i, sequence in enumerate(sequences):
    results[i, sequence] = 1
  return results


x_train = vectorize_sequences(train_data)
x_test = vectorize_sequences(test_data)
y_train = np.asarray(train_label).astype('float32')
y_test = np.asarray(test_label).astype('float32')


* imdb.load_data(num_words=10000): This line loads the IMDB dataset. The num_words argument specifies that only the 10,000 most frequent words will be considered. Each review is represented as a list of integer indices, where each index corresponds to a word in the vocabulary.
* vectorize_sequences function: This function takes a list of sequences (reviews) and converts them into a binary matrix. The matrix has dimensions (number of sequences, 10000). Each row represents a review, and a 1 at a certain index indicates the presence of that word in the review. Reviews are essentially converted into a "bag of words" representation.
* Data transformation:
   * x_train and x_test: These variables hold the vectorized training and testing data, respectively.
   * y_train and y_test: These variables hold the sentiment labels (positive: 1, negative: 0) for the training and testing data, converted to floats using astype('float32').
Model Definition:
Python
model = Sequential()


model.add(Dense(16, input_shape=(10000,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))


model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy'])


model.summary()


* Sequential model: A sequential neural network is created.
* Hidden layers:
   * model.add(Dense(16, input_shape=(10000,), activation='relu')): The first hidden layer has 16 neurons, takes input of size 10000 (matching the vectorized data dimensions), and uses the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function.
   * model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu')): The second hidden layer also has 16 neurons and uses the ReLU activation.
* Output layer:
   * model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')): The output layer has 1 neuron and uses the sigmoid activation function. Since the task is binary classification (positive or negative sentiment), the sigmoid function is suitable as it outputs values between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities of being positive.
* Model compilation:
   * model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['accuracy']): The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function (suitable for regression-like tasks here), and accuracy as a metric for evaluation.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Python
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, validation_split=0.2, epochs=20, verbose=1


The remaining part of the code focuses on evaluating the trained model's performance and interpreting some of the results. Here's a breakdown:
Model Evaluation:
Python
mse, mae = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)


print('MSE ', mse)
print('MAE ', mae)


* model.evaluate(x_test, y_test): This line evaluates the model on the test data (x_test and y_test). The evaluation returns two metrics:
   * mse: Mean squared error, which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual sentiment labels (ideally as close to 0 as possible).
   * mae: Mean absolute error, which measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual sentiment labels (ideally as close to 0 as possible).
Predicting on New Data:
Python
y_preds = model.predict(x_test)


y_preds


y_test


* model.predict(x_test): This line uses the trained model to predict sentiment labels for the test data (x_test). y_preds now holds the predicted probabilities of each review being positive (between 0 and 1).
Thresholding Predictions:
Python
tests = []
for i in y_test:
  tests.append(int(i))


preds = []
for i in y_preds:
  if i[0] > 0.5:
    preds.append(1)
  else:
    preds.append(0)


* This code block converts the predicted probabilities (y_preds) into binary class labels (positive or negative):
   * tests: This list holds the actual sentiment labels from y_test, converted to integers (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
   * preds: This list holds the predicted class labels. It iterates through each predicted probability in y_preds and assigns a class label based on a threshold of 0.5. If the probability (i[0]) is greater than 0.5, it's classified as positive (1), otherwise negative (0).
Evaluation Metrics:
Python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score


print(accuracy_score(tests, preds))
print(precision_score(tests, preds))
print(recall_score(tests, preds))


* These lines import three evaluation metrics from sklearn.metrics:
   * accuracy_score: Calculates the overall accuracy of the model's predictions (percentage of correct classifications).
   * precision_score: Measures the proportion of positive predictions that were actually positive (precision).
   * recall_score: Measures the proportion of actual positive reviews that were correctly classified as positive (recall).
These metrics provide a more comprehensive picture of the model's performance beyond just mean squared error or mean absolute error. Accuracy tells you the overall percentage of correct predictions, while precision and recall offer insights into how well the model identifies positive and negative reviews accurately.
Looking at Examples:
Python
# word_index is a dictionary mapping words to an integer index
word_index = imdb.get_word_index()


def return_token(tid):
  for k, v in word_index.items():
    # We decode the review; note that our indices were offset by 3
    # because 0, 1 and 2 are reserved indices for "padding", "start of sequence", and "unknown".
    if v == tid - 3:
      return k
  return '?'


def print_review(id_):
  sentence = ' '.join(return_token(i) for i in train_data[id_])
  return sentence


train_label[0]  # Positive


print_review(1)


train_label[1]  # Negative


print_review(2)


* This section retrieves the word-to-index mapping (word_index) from the imdb dataset. This allows us to convert the integer-based reviews back into human-readable words.
* The return_token function takes an integer index and looks it up in the word_index dictionary to return the corresponding word.
* The print_review function takes a review ID and uses return_token to convert the integer indices in the review (stored in train_data) back into words, forming a complete sentence.
* Finally, the code prints the sentiment labels for the first two reviews in the training data (train_label[0] and train_label[1]) and then uses print_review to
